## About

I created this project to learn about TypeSpec through first-hand usage.

The generated Open API 3 specification has 878 lines (with no blank lines) in a
single file. The TypeSpec source has 493 lines (about â…“ are blank lines for
readability) split across 8 files for logical organization, which is a ~45%
reduction in lines of code.

If we ignore the imports, using statements, and blank lines within models, then
the TypeSpec only has 353 lines. That means a 60% reduction in code to maintain.

## Installation

Follow these steps to consume the generated Open API specification for SWAPI.

1. Install this package as a dependency.

   ```sh
   npm install -D swapi-typespec
   ```

2. Reference the generated Open API specification directly.
